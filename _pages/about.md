*Professor of Integrated Circuit and EECS*  
*Boya Distinguished Professor of Peking University*  
*ACM Distinguished Scientist/Member*

I am an Endowed Boya Distinguished Professor in the School of Integrated Circuit and School of EECS at Peking University. My research interest is at the hardware-software interface with work spanning electronic design automation (EDA), hardware and software co-design, and computer architecture. My recent publications investigate new algorithms, programming models, design automation tools and methodologies, and hardware for high-performance and energy-efficient computer systems. I have authored over 100 scientific publications in the leading international journals and conferences. My research has been recognized with four Best Paper Awards, six Best Paper Award Nominations, National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, CCF-IEEE CS Young Computer Scientist Award, Beijing Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI) Young Scientist Award, and National Youth Top-notch Talent Fund. I am an ACM Distinguished Scientist/Member and received the Teaching Excellence Award Peking University in 2024. 

I currently serve as Associate Editor of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS) and ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS). I was the program chair of 30th Annual IEEE International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architecture and Processors (ASAP) 2019 and the International Conference on Field Programmable Technology (FPT) 2022. I also serve in the program committees in the premier conferences including DAC, ICCAD, FPGA, FCCM, HPCA, MICRO, DATE, ASPDAC, ASPLOS, ISCA, PPoPP, PACT, CGO, ICS, CC, CASES, LCTES, ASAP, and ICCD. Prior to joining Peking University, I received my Ph.D in Computer Science from National University of Singapore in 2010. Upon graduation, I worked as a Research Scientist in UIUC.


## To Perspective Postdocs, Students, and Interns

I am looking for highly motivated graduate students, postdocs, and interns to work on system research including algorithms, programming language, compiler, embedded systems, and electronic design automation. Students with strong hands-on system building skills and algorithm background are especially welcomed.
